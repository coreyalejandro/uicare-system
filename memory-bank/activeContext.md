# UICare System Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The UICare System project is currently focused on developing the MoodRING web app component, with a foundation already in place. The current implementation includes:

1. Next.js application with React context for state management
2. Reality filters for modifying visual experience (Standard, Ninja Vision, Protocol)
3. Persistent settings for customizing filter intensity and audio feedback
4. Responsive UI with accessibility considerations

## Recent Changes

- Implemented the reality filter system with three modes:
  - Standard: Default visual experience
  - Ninja Vision: Enhanced contrast and focus
  - Protocol: Red tint with optional audio feedback
- Added settings persistence using localStorage
- Created the UIcareToolbar for easy access to reality filters and settings
- Implemented the documentation page with detailed explanations of features

## Next Steps

1. **Azure AI Integration**:
   - Connect to Azure AI Agents for mood detection
   - Implement suggestion generation based on detected moods
   - Create a feedback loop for improving AI accuracy

2. **VSCode Extension Development**:
   - Begin development of the extension skeleton
   - Implement the monitor module for detecting frustration loops
   - Create the context aggregator for collecting coding context
   - Develop the suggestion panel UI

3. **Enhancement of MoodRING**:
   - Add more reality filter options
   - Improve performance of filter transitions
   - Enhance mobile responsiveness
   - Add more customization options

4. **Testing and Refinement**:
   - Implement comprehensive accessibility testing
   - Gather user feedback on existing features
   - Optimize performance metrics

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **AI Privacy**: Determining the right balance between effective mood detection and user privacy
2. **Filter Performance**: Ensuring CSS filters perform well across devices and browsers
3. **Extension Architecture**: Deciding on the best approach for monitoring coding patterns without impacting editor performance
4. **Accessibility**: Ensuring all features are accessible to users with various needs
5. **Mobile Experience**: Adapting the toolbar and filters for smaller screens
